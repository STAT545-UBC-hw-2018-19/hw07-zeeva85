About me
--------

My name is **Seevasant Indran**. I am from Kuala lumpur, Malaysia :malaysia:. I came to Vancouver in September 2017 to pursue a Masters in **Genome Science and Technology (GSAT)**. I did my undergraduate in Melbourne, Australia. I have previously worked on projects exploring bacteriophages associated _Helicobacter pylori_ genetic plasticity and their association in Gastric cancer at the Marshall center and Intergrin mechanotransduction in Mesenchymal Stem cell at the Tissue Engineering Group, University of Malaya. 

If you are interested, my publications are below:-


1. [Helicobacter pylori Genetic Diversity and Gastro-duodenal Diseases in Malaysia][Hpylori]
2. [Potential of apoptotic pathway-targeted cancer therapeutic research: Where do we stand?][CancerReview]

[CancerReview]: https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2015275

I am currently attached to the [**Loewen lab**][loewenlablink] which is located at the Life Sciences Institute working on evaluating the significance of unknown variances (SUV) in cancer drivers using _Sacharomyces Cerevisiae_ (yeast) as a model organism. Yeast is an ideal model organism because it is easy to genetically perturb genes in yeast, it has a high growth rate which means, experiments can be conducted in a shorter frame of time. It is the only organism that has a genome-wide knockout of every (non-esential) gene. Eventhough it doesnt not have all the human genes, the [table][ChoromosomeNumberTbl] below clearly shows that the complexity of an organism is not defined by how many chromosome, the number of genes  or even the size its genome. Additionally over the years, many human genes that are not naturally present has be inserted or complemented in yeast to study funtional global genetic interaction for the identification of intractive nodes and its clusters.
